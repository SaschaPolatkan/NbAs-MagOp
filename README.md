# NbAs-MagOp
Contains code to produce magneto optical spectra for a model Hamiltonian, meant to reproduce measurements on NbAs.
NbAs measurements were taken in the research facility LNCMI Grenoble, where measurements can be performed in Faraday geometry to measure Landau levels.
NbAs was measured in a superconducting coil up to 13 Tesla.
