# NbAs-MagOp

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SaschaPolatkan/NbAs-MagOp/main?labpath=NbAs_Hyperbolic.ipynb)

A program to calculate magneto-optical transitions for a Weyl semimetal compound NbAs. Currently faulty. Click on "launch" to launch a virtual environment that runs my Jupyter script via Binder without prerequirements. To run the code on your own machine, check the requirements.txt file, to find the required packages to run the code.
